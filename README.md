This project analyzes Virginia's public art landscape using data from the Public Art Archive, exploring geographic distribution, artwork types, creation timelines, and how Virginia compares to global public art trends. An infographic visualizes key findings. The analysis uncovers how geography, community values, and economic conditions shape Virginia's unique public art ecosystem. For a detailed breakdown of the data collection, cleaning process, design decisions, and full analysis, see the [project notebook](https://github.com/kenzkleczynski/Public-Art-Archive/blob/main/Notebooks/Final_Product.ipynb).
